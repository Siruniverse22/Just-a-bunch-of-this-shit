# FlashLoanProfitProject

This project is a software solution to leverage uncollateralized instant flash loans for profitable blockchain transactions including arbitrage trading, yield farming with leverage, and just-in-time liquidity provision.

## Features

- User registration with email and wallet address.
- Backend server to handle user input and transaction orchestration.
- Solidity smart contract to execute flash loan transactions atomically.
- Framework to integrate with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and yield farming protocols.
- Algorithms to analyze market opportunities and risks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Solidity development environment (e.g., Hardhat or Truffle)
- Ethereum wallet and testnet access

### Installation

1. Install backend dependencies:

```bash
cd FlashLoanProfitProject
npm install
```

2. Compile and deploy smart contracts using your preferred Solidity development environment.

3. Run the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

- Register users via the `/register` API endpoint with email and wallet address.
- The smart contract can be triggered to start flash loan transactions.
- Profits from transactions are sent to the registered wallet address.

### Deploying Smart Contract

1. Install Hardhat and dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @openzeppelin/contracts
```

2. Compile the contract:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

3. Deploy the contract to a local or test network:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat
```

4. Replace the deployed contract address in `scripts/interact.js` before running interaction scripts.

### Running Interaction Script

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js --network hardhat
```

## Future Work

- Implement detailed arbitrage, yield farming, and JIT liquidity strategies in the smart contract.
- Integrate real-time data feeds and flash loan providers.
- Add frontend interface for user interaction.

## Autonomy

The project includes an `autonomousRunner.js` script that simulates autonomous operation by:

- Periodically fetching market data (placeholder logic).
- Analyzing data to identify profitable strategies.
- Automatically triggering flash loan transactions via the smart contract.

To run the autonomous runner:

```bash
node autonomousRunner.js
```

This script runs every 5 minutes and can be extended to integrate real data sources and advanced decision algorithms for full autonomy.
